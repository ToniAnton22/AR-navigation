# AR-navigation
AR-navigation is a mobile application developed for the purpose of completing an unversity assignment, however, I will be building on top of it starting June 2023.
An map application that allows you to use your camera to see different points of interests using OpenGL to build AR environment. I use Kotlin as the main language
however, I have some java classes for the conversions that happen within my application. 

This is nowhere near a final product, as there is a lot to be worked on. However, the main functionalities seem to be working, but I have to solve some major bugs regarding the notification system, and the Cube renderer, as it doesn't render the colors of the cubes.

#More Updates to come
